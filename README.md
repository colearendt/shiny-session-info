# Shiny Session Info

This Shiny app uses `listviewer` to explore the Shiny Session info present
during a Shiny runtime.

There is an example of doing this with a [module](./module.app.R) as well.

## NOTES

- This application uses an HTMLWidget that has shown fragility with a large
number of groups. If you see issues and have a large number of groups, you may
need to refresh your browser.
